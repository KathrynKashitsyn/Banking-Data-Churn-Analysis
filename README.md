# Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn for a European bank which has operations in France, Germany and Spain 
The goal is to identify key factors driving customer churn and to build a predictive model that can flag customers at high risk of leaving.

Customer churn is a major challenge in subscription-based businesses. We define it as follows: customer churn occurs when a client who was using our services stops doing business with our bank. 

The ultimate business objective is to reduce churn rate by enabling proactive retention campaigns.

Key Questions this analysis aims to answer:

- Which customer segments have the highest churn rate and risk?
- What are the most significant predictors of customer churn?
- What is the expected performance and business value of the churn prediction model?


In this project, I analyze a customer dataset to uncover patterns behind churn and build predictive models to identify customers at risk of leaving.  The project includes:

- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning modeling & evaluation
- Communicating actionable business insights
